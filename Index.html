<h3> Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina </h3>
<p> Bangladesh’s Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said recently that it didn’t matter at all if people from her country didn’t fly to the United States, adding that “there are other oceans and other continents in the world.”

    “We will not be dependent on others, who will not give us visas,” she said.
    
    Her comments came in response to a warning from Washington that it would slap visa restrictions on Bangladeshi citizens who undermine the democratic election process at home.
    
    The new US visa policy was announced ahead of national elections that are due to be held in the South Asian country by January 2024.
    
    The last two general elections, held in 2014 and 2018, were marred by allegations of massive vote rigging and intimidation of opposition activists, charges denied by Hasina’s government.
    Can Bangladesh move away from the US?
    
    The United States is the largest importer of Bangladeshi products, importing $8.3 billion (€7.65 billion) worth of goods in 2021, according to the US Department of State. And US companies are among the largest foreign investors in the Muslim-majority country.
    
    Observers believe that Hasina's remarks on the United States sound like and "attempt to be defiant".
    
    “Given how so much of the Bangladeshi political class — including Hasina herself — has family members in the US, it would be misleading to suggest that not having the capacity to fly to the US is no big deal,” Michael Kugelman, the director of the South Asia Institute at Washington-based Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, told DW.
    Bangladesh plans to join the five-nation BRICS bloc, where China and Russia dominate. </p>

<h3> Bangladesh plans to join the five-nation BRICS bloc, where China and Russia dominate </h3>
<p> Jasmin Lorch, a South Asia analyst and guest lecturer at the Humboldt University of Berlin, echoed Kugelman’s sentiments. She pointed out that Bangladesh’s ruling Awami League party members have a strong connection with the US.

    “Sheikh Hasina has increasingly been relying on anti-American rhetoric. At the same time, many high-ranking Awami League officials and sympathisers of the party travel to the US for holidays or have their children study in US universities and colleges,” Lorch told DW.</p>
<h2> Bangladesh ‘could benefit’ from joining BRICS </h2>
<p> Meanwhile, Bangladesh plans to join BRICS in August. The country’s Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen confirmed the decision during a press briefing in Geneva on Wednesday after a meeting between Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.

    The acronym began as a somewhat optimistic term to describe what were the world’s fastest-growing economies at the time. But now the BRICS nations — Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa — offer a diplomatic forum and development financing outside of Western-dominated global financial institutions.</p>

<h3>Economic growth in BRICS countries </h3>
<p> South Asia expert Kugelman thinks that the Hasina government’s move could benefit the country if done correctly.

    “If Dhaka plays its cards right, it could gain a lot from participating in BRICS while also continuing to scale up trade and diplomatic ties with the West,” Kugelman pointed out. “It would be wrong for Dhaka to join BRICS as a tactic to defy the West. But it can certainly help advance its foreign policy interests.”</p>
